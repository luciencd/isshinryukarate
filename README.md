This project will catalog many of the aspects of Isshinryu Karate in JSON format.

I will also be integrating it with alexa, and creating many hands-free applications to make it easy to practice when not in the dojo.

Todo:
1. Get Basics catalogued in JSON.
2. Get 4 first katas (seisan,seiuchin,nihanchi,wansu) in JSON
3. Get Basic Question and answers for history memorization in JSON.
4. Randomized move alexa app based on basics.
5. Entire basics timed in alexa app, with continue options and checkpoints.
6. Basic question and answer alexa app on karate history.
